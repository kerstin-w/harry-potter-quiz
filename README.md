[_Sourced via ColorsWall._](https://colorswall.com/palette/167374)

A simple color palette was chosen to reflect the dark and magical character of the Harry Potter world. The background has a dark gradient and the white or light turquoise font stands out well and is easy to read. For the game, the colors of the four Hogwards houses were adopted again to stay in the theme. However, the original yellow had to be changed to orange because of insufficient contrast.

### <a name="fonts">Fonts</a>

**Heading:** For Heading 1, ""Harry Potter" font was selected, which is very unique and directly recognized by users. This stands out beautifully as the heading.

**Body:** “Nunito”. This font is simple, modern open and easy to read. The round cap strokes matches well with the round box design on the page.
